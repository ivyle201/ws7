I've fostered rabbits for the local SPCA, and this book definitely helped me understand rabbits and their behavior.  I would recommend it for any rabbit owner, as it contains a lot of information.   <br /> <br />I had spent a considerable time searching the internet for information on rabbits, and if I'd bought this book first, I could have saved a lot of time and learned a lot more a lot faster.
FINALLY - someone who wrote the TRUTH about good rabbit care (for the most part). I'm glad to see a book out there that isn't jaded by the House Rabbit Society. Would like to see more influence from the ARBA (Yes, they promote pet rabbits too!) <br /> <br />But the book is filled with good and correct information. Including the fact that your rabbit DOESN'T need to be kept indoors like some people think.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book over most of the rabbit books out there on the market.  <br /> <br />KUDOS and keep up the good work.
This book is a great introduction to the world of the companion rabbit. It provides quick access to easy to understand tibits about common rabbit concerns. It's written in a manner that is able to keep most people's attention and interest. <br />The only problem I have with the book is the fact that it doesn't emphasize that rabbits should not be kept in hutches. Rabbits, regardless of size, should be kept in a set-up that is more akin to that of a dog pen.  An area that measures approximately four feet by four feet that is fenced off INSIDE your home will be a better set-up for your new lagomorph. They need space to run around and play while you are at work or school and the wire bottom of pet-store rabbit cages can be very harsh on their feet. They do not have foot-pads like dogs or cats. If you value the health of your new companion, please use a dog pen.<br />I recommend looking into adopting a rabbit from your local House Rabbit Society chapter ([...] Rabbits from pet stores are often sick and not litterbox trained (yes, they are easily trained and very clean animals).<br />That all said, please read this book before you purchase a bunny.  I also recommend reading &quot;The House Rabbit Handbook: Living With an Urban Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Rabbit Health in the 21st Century.&quot; Rabbits are much different from dogs and cats and have special health concerns, but can make great pets for the right people.
This book is a must-have for new rabbit owners, and even people who've had rabbits for years could benefit from it.  It explains the responsibilities that come with caring for a rabbit, and it does so in very clear language...but it doesn't make you feel like a dummy.  It outlines the physical needs of rabbits, but I especially appreciate how it addresses rabbits' often-overlooked psychological needs as well.  This is a great starter book...I recommend bringing it home the same day as your new bunny, like I did.
Excellent book for first time rabbit guardians. Its the next best thing to speaking fluent rabbit. Its easy to understand and packed with very useful information. Its a good companion book for the House Rabbit Handbook or Why does my rabbit...? books. It is definately a good investment.
